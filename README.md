# CS50x Solutions

Welcome to my CS50x repository!  

This repository contains **all my solutions for the CS50x course**, from Problem Set 1 to Problem Set 9. It is intended to **track my progress, document my learning, and improve my problem-solving and programming skills in C**.

## Repository Structure
- `pset1/`, `pset2/`, ..., `pset9/`: each folder corresponds to a CS50x problem set.  
- Inside each `psetX/` folder, there is the solution code for each problem.
